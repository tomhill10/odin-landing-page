            <p>When it comes to our brand, I'm passionate about making sure that we take as much care over the details of our designs as we do over the materials we use and the colours we offer each season. We work with manufacturers who help us bring our designs to life. It's important to me that we continue to improve the sustainability of our products and one of my priorities is to ensure that our supply chain works to the best industry standards at all times.
